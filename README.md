# Indian Road Accident Analysis - Tableau
## Overview
Welcome to the Indian Road Accident Analysis project! This repository focuses on analyzing road accident data using Tableau. The project involves a comprehensive approach, including data cleaning, data processing, data modeling, and connecting Tableau with a CSV file. The resulting Tableau dashboard includes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Total Casualties, Accident Count, and types of accidents for the current year and the previous year. Year-to-Date (YTD) and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth calculations are implemented using DAX. The dashboard also incorporates maps, graphs, and slicers for enhanced visualization.
